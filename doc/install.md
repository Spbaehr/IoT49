# Install the uPython Programming Environment

These instructions have been tested on *macOS Sierra* Version 10.12.6 and Windows 10. The installation on Linux is similar with a few changes depending on the version of Linux you are using.

## 1) Install the USB Driver

Download and install the CP210X USB driver from [https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

For windows there are two versions: `x64` is for newer 64-Bit CPUs, while `x86` is for 32-Bit computers. Pick the right one for your computer. Unless it is quite old, that's likely `x64`. All Mac's are 64-Bit.

**Note:** Installing drivers typically requires *Administrator Privileges*. On the EECS IoT49 Lab computers the USB driver has already been installed for you.

## 2) Install Python 3

Install [Python 3.6](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Check the option to add python to the path.

After completing the installation, open a terminal window and type `python` at the prompt. Verify that Python announces itself with the correct version (3.6 or later). Type `exit()` to quit the Python interpreter.

__Note:__ If a version of Python 3.6 is already installed on your computer you may want to give it a try. But beware all testing has been done with the Miniconda distribution and subtle (or not so subtle) problems have been encountered with other versions. `shell49` (below) does not run on Python 2.

## 3) Install `shell49`

Navigate to [https://github.com/bboser/shell49](https://github.com/bboser/shell49) and follow the instructions to install `shell49`.

## 4) Flash the MicroPython Firmware to the ESP32

Connect the ESP32 to a free USB port of the computer. At the command prompt type

```
shell49 -a
```

At the `shell49` prompt, enter

```
ports
```

This will print the name of the USB port. If more than one name appears, disconnect the ESP32 and repeat the `ports` command. The port name that disappeared is the one you are looking for. If this procedure fails, check [permissions](usb.md) and, if this does not solve the problem, follow these [alternate instructions](usb_port.md).

**Note:** Some USB cables are only for charging and miss the necessary wires for data communication. If the `ports` command does not display a port name, try with a different cable, e.g. one available in the lab.

Again at the `shell49` prompt, enter the commands below. Replace `<port>` with the port name returned by the `ports` command. For example, if the port is `COM3`, the command is `config --default port COM3`.

```
config --default port <port>
config --default board HUZZAH32
config --default time_offset 0
flash -e
```

Typing

```
config
```

at the `shell49` prompt shows all configuration parameters. Use this to verify that you entered values correctly. `shell49` saves these values in a file so you won't have to retype them each time.

This flashes the MicroPython firmware to the ESP32. **Carefully** check the long and verbose output for error messages. If there are none, *press the reset button on the HUZZAH32 board* and rerun the `ports` command.

If the USB port of the ESP32 is no longer listed, disconnect and then reconnect the USB cable and try the `ports` command again. Then at the `shell49` command prompt type:

```
connect serial
repl
```

If all goes well, you will be getting a `REPL prompt` from MicroPython running on the ESP32! Try a few Python commands, e.g.

```
1+1
2**100
for i in range(4):
    print(i, i**2)
from machine import Pin
from board import LED
led = Pin(LED, mode=Pin.OUT)
led(1)
```

See how the microcontroller lights up the world ...

```
led(0)
```

to conserve energy.

When you are done experimenting, type `Ctrl-X` to exit `repl` and return to the `shell49` command prompt. `Ctrl-D` exits `shell49` and passes control to the operating system.

From now on, when you start `shell49` (without the `-a`), the program automatically establishes a serial connection to the ESP32 connected with a USB cable. In `shell49`, you can use commands such as `repl` (`help` at the prompt lists other available commands). Flashing is only needed once or to update or reinstall MicroPython.

**Note:**  Distinguish of the following different command prompts:

* Operating system (Mac/Linux/Windows) command prompt (e.g. `$`): Used to run operating system commands and programs (e.g. `python`, `pip`) and to start `shell49`.
* `shell49` prompt (`>`): used to interact with the ESP32 board using commands such as `flash`, `repl`, `ports`.
* `repl` prompt (`>>>`): use to run Python on the ESP32 board. If you get error messages such as `run is not a valid Python instruction` it may be that you are trying to execute a `shell49` command with Python. Quit `repl` with `Ctrl-X`, look for the single chevron (`>`) identifying the `shell49` prompt, and try again.

## 6) Get a Text Editor

To write programs you need a text editor. Any plain text editor can be used (e.g. `TextEdit` or `Notepad`), but editors with Python syntax highlighting improve readability and some even help identifying syntax errors.

A [web search](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) lists many options to choose from. If you are already familiar with a suitable editor, use it.

If you prefer an ```Integrated Programming Environment (IDE)``` which  keeps track of your project, one option is the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io), used in the lecture.

`Atom` comes with many optional plug-ins with useful features. For example, `linter-pyflakes`, when installed, highlights Python syntax errors in the editor window. Search the web for documentation and installation instructions and do not hesitate posing questions and sharing tips on `Piazza`.
