# Install the uPython Programming Environment on Windows

These instructions have been tested on *Windows 10 Pro* Version 16.07 and may need modifications on other versions of Windows. Read the entire document before starting the install.

## 1) Install the USB Driver

Download and install the CP210X USB driver from [https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). Choose the default version (not the one with Serial Enumeration).

**Important:** For later steps you will need to know the `COM` port of the USB device. To find out what it is, open the Windows `Device Manager`. Click the Windows button (typically in the lower left of the corner of the screen) and type `device` in the search box. Click `Device Manager`. 

Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to a free USB port. Then open the tab `Ports (COM & LPT)` in the device manager. Look for the line starting with `Silicon Labs CP210x`. The port you are looking for is listed in parantheses at the end of the line, e.g. `COM3`. Be sure to always connect the ESP32 to the same physical USB port as the port number may be different for other connectors. 

Installing drivers requires *Administrator Privileges*. On the EECS IoT49 Labs computers the USB driver has already been installed for you.

## 2) Install Python 3

Download and install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org) from [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

In the installer window, make sure that `Install launcher` and `Add Python 3.6 to PATH` are checked.

Bring up a Command Prompt (click the Windows or Start button, type `cmd` and click `Command Prompt`).

At the command prompt type `python`. Verify that Python announces itself with the correct version (3.6). Type `exit()` to quit the Python interpreter.

Back at the Windows Command Prompt, issue the following instructions to install additional packages:

```
pip install pyserial
pip install matplotlib
```

## 3) Download the Programming Environment

Install `git` from [https://git-for-windows.github.io](https://git-for-windows.github.io). Accept the default options.

Click the Windows button and type `git` in the search field. Click on `Git Bash`. In the window that opens type the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/bboser/IoT49.git
cd IoT49
pwd
```

This downloads the `IoT49 MicroPython programming environment` to the hard drive of your computer and prints the path where it is installed (e.g. `C:\Users\joe\IoT49`). Take a note of this path, you will need it in step 4 below.

**Updates:** If you ever need to update the environment, open a `Git Bash` window and enter the following commands:

```
cd IoT49
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
``` 

## 4) Update the Command Search Path

Click the Windows button and type `env`, then click `Edit environment variables for your account`.

Under `User variables for ...`, select `Path` and click `Edit...`. Click new and enter the path where you copied the EE49 Programming Environment, followed by `\bin`. E.g. `C:\Users\joe\IoT49\bin`. Click `OK`.

Back to the screen showing `User variables for ...`, select `New` to create the following environment variables (update the values to reflect your setup):

Variable      | Value
------------- | -------------
IOT49         | C:\Users\joe\IoT49
PYTHONPATH    | C:\Users\joe\IoT49\bin\lib
RSHELL_PORT   | COM3

Hit `OK` a couple of times to quit the variable editor. Close and reopen all Command Prompt Windows to update them to the new environment you just set.

## 5) Flash the MicroPython Firmware to the ESP32

Connect the ESP32 to the computer via USB. Open a Windows `Command Prompt` and type 

```
flash.py
sync.py
```

The first command installs the MicroPython interpreter on the ESP32. `sync.py` copies Python library files to the microcontroller. You also use this program to upload Python code you wrote. If you get a warning from `flash.py` that the firmware could not be installed, try running the command again. If the problem persists, unplug and replug the ESP32 or try a different USB port or computer. Following the instructions in step 1 above, verify that that COM port number is still correct and update the `RSHELL_PORT` environment variable if it has changed.

You can also erase the entire flash of the microcontroller (if something bad happens, e.g. you flashed a program with an infinite loop) by executing `erase_flash.py` from the `Command Prompt`.

**Warning:** Only one USB connection can be active. You may need to quit the Atom IDE (see next section) before using `flash.py` and `sync.py`.

## 6) Install the Atom IDE

Download and install the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) from {https://atom.io}(https://atom.io). Once installed, start the editor by clicking on the green icon on the desktop. Choose `File->Settings` and click on `+ Install`. Search for `pymakr`. Scroll down to the package with name `Pymakr` in click the install button.

From `File` choose `Add Projects Folder...`. Navigate to `C:\Users\joe\IoT49\esp32` and click `Select Folder`.

After `Pymakr` is downloaded and installed, the MicroPython command window appears near the bottom of the Atom IDE. Click `Settings->Project Settings` and edit the value of the field `"address"` to match the USB port the ESP32 is connected to (e.g. `COM3`). Click `Connect`. 

If all goes well, the ESP32 announces itself by printing the version  (e.g. `IoT49-2017-11-12`) and other details about the installed firmware. 

The `>>>` is the MicroPython prompt. Commands you type here are sent to the ESP32 for execution and the results displayed back here. Try `5-9` or `for i in range(5): print(i**2)`. Have fun exploring!
